- used a modelling approach for thousands of species globally
- conducted variable selection prior to modelling 




### New figures

Heat map with a cities with the changes 

Check for difference in cities between SSP -  sort by change in predicted occurrence

Plot the change with latitude


### meeting with Scott

Ridge line vs. density plot
Whether to include the area of species
Have a threshold for removing species below a certain probability of occurrence


Shifting baseline syndrome
